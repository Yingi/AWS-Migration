<font size="5"> Below is the Solution approach on the architecture i will consider

I will be dividing the architecture into Six stages

* Stage 1: CONTAINERIZE THE APPLICATION LAYER
* Stage 2: MIGRATE THE DATABASE LAYER TO AN UPGRADED SQL SERVER CLUSTER (2016) IN THE CLOUD
* Stage 3: DEPLOY THE CONTAINERIZED APPLICATION TO A KUBERNETES CLUSTER
* Stage 4: INTEGRATE THE CONTAINERIZED APPLICATION TO THE SQL SERVER 2016 INSTANCE
* Stage 5: INTEGRATE ON-PREMISE SAP ERP TO THE CONTAINERIZED APPLICATION IN THE CLOUD
* Stage 6: MIGRATING THE EXTERNAL DATABASE APLLICTATIONS


LETS BEGIN


## Stage 1: CONTAINERIZE THE APPLICATION LAYER

WE will have to containerize the application using Docker and ensure that it uses Windows Server 2016 base image:


* Create a new Windows Server 2016 base image: We will need to create a new base image of Windows Server 2016 that will be used to build the container. We will use Docker
* Install the application on the new base image: Once we have created the new base image, we can install the application on it. we will need to make sure that all the necessary dependencies, libraries, and configurations are in place for the application to run properly.
* Create a container from the image: Once the application is installed on the new base image, we can use Docker to create a container from the image. This will package the application and its dependencies into a single, portable container.
* Push the container image: Push container image to container registry such as Docker Hub or Google Container Registry.
* We may need to make some adjustments to the application, such as updating libraries, drivers, and configurations, to make sure the application is compatible with Windows Server 2016.





## STAGE 2: MIGRATE THE DATABASE LAYER TO AN UPGRADED SQL SERVER CLUSTER (2016) IN THE CLOUD

Here are technical steps that can be used to migrate a shared database running on Windows Server 2008 R2 to an AWS cloud database running Windows Server 2016:

* Create an Amazon RDS instance for SQL Server 2016, this will be the target database.

* Create a backup of the source database and store it in an S3 bucket for easy access.

* Create a new Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance running Windows Server 2016, this will be used as a migration host.

* On the migration host, install the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and the AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) connectors.

* Use the SSMS to restore the backup of the source database to the migration host.

* Use the AWS DMS to create a replication task that will migrate the data from the source database to the target RDS instance.

* Configure the replication task to include all necessary data and schema objects, such as tables, views, stored procedures, and indexes.

* Start the replication task, monitor its progress and troubleshoot if necessary.

* Once the migration is complete, run validation tests to ensure that the data in the target RDS instance is accurate and consistent with the source database.




## STAGE 3: DEPLOY THE CONTAINERIZED APPLICATION TO A KUBERNETES CLUSTER

We will deploy our application container image to the Kubernetes Cluster

![alt text](https://github.com/Yingi/AWS-Migration/blob/main/Stage4.jpg?raw=true)


* Create a Kubernetes cluster: You can use a service such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to create a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud.


* Create a Kubernetes deployment: Use a Kubernetes deployment file, such as a YAML file, to define the desired state of your application in the cluster. This will include things like the number of replicas, resource requirements, and the container image to use.

* Create a Kubernetes service: Create a Kubernetes service to expose the application to the network. This will create an endpoint for the application that can be accessed by external clients.

* Deploy the application: Use the Kubernetes command line tool, kubectl, to deploy the application to the cluster. This will create the deployment, service, and any other resources defined in the YAML file.

* Scale the application: As needed, use kubectl to scale up or down the number of replicas of your application, allowing the cluster to automatically handle the increase or decrease of traffic.

* Monitor the application: Use Kubernetes built-in monitoring and logging functionality or external tools to monitor the application and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.




## STAGE 4: INTEGRATE THE CONTAINERIZED APPLICATION TO THE SQL SERVER 2016 INSTANCE

There are several ways to integrate a containerized application with a SQL Server 2016 instance in the cloud:

* Connect the container to the SQL Server instance using a connection string: You can specify the connection string in the environment variables of the container and use it to connect the application to the SQL Server instance.

OR

* Use a service discovery tool: Kubernetes, for example, provides a service discovery tool that can be used to automatically discover and connect to the SQL Server instance. This would allow the application to connect to the SQL Server instance without hardcoding the connection string.


## STAGE 5: INTEGRATE ON-PREMISE SAP ERP TO THE CONTAINERIZED APPLICATION IN THE CLOUD

Here are the steps we can take to configure the web service to ensure proper integration between the containerized application and the on-premise SAP:

* Configure the web service in the containerized application: You will need to configure the web service in the containerized application to allow it to communicate with the on-premise SAP system. This may involve configuring the web service endpoint, setting up security credentials, and making any necessary code changes to the application.

* Configure the SAP PI middleware: The SAP PI middleware acts as a bridge between the containerized application and the on-premise SAP system. We will need to configure the SAP PI middleware to ensure that it can communicate with the web service in the containerized application. This may involve configuring the web service endpoint, setting up security credentials, and making any necessary code changes to the SAP PI middleware.

Test the integration: Once the web service and SAP PI middleware are configured, we will test the integration to ensure that the containerized application and on-premise SAP system can communicate properly. This may involve sending test messages or data between the two systems to ensure that they are properly configured.

Configure the appropriate security measures: It's important to configure appropriate security measures to protect the communication between the containerized application and the on-premise SAP. This may include setting up firewalls, VPNs, or other security protocols to ensure that only authorized communication is allowed.

Monitor the integration: Once the integration is set up, we will have to monitor the communication between the containerized application and the on-premise SAP to ensure that it is running smoothly. This may involve setting up monitoring and logging to detect and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

The integration process might require some adjustments to the application, such as updating libraries, drivers, and configurations, to make sure the application is compatible with the on-premise SAP.



## STAGE 6: MIGRATING THE EXTERNAL DATABASE APLLICTATIONS

The external database applications are integrated with the shared database through complex SQL queries, stored procedures, or jobs, so it may be necessary to also migrate those applications to AWS

* Create a backup of the external databases and store them in an S3 bucket for easy access.

* Create a new Amazon RDS instance or Amazon Aurora cluster running the same version of the database software as the external databases.

* Restore the backups of the external databases to the new RDS instances or Aurora cluster.

* Test the restored databases to ensure that they are working correctly and that all data is present.

* Update the application's connection strings to point to the new RDS instances or Aurora cluster.

* Test the application to ensure that it is able to connect to and query the new RDS instances.

* For the integration with the external databases, you can use the Database Migration Service (DMS) that allows you to replicate and migrate data from a source database, like the on-premise SQL Server, to a target database in AWS.

* Once the migration is complete, monitor the performance of the RDS instances or Aurora cluster, and troubleshoot as needed.
