Below is the Solution approach on the architecture i will consider

I will be dividing the architecture into four stages

* Stage 1: MIGRATING THE SQL SERVER CLUSTER TO AWS RDS
* Stage 2: MIGRATING THE APPLICATION LAYER TO AWS CLOUD
* Stage 3: INTEGRATING ON-PREMISE SAP ERP TO THE MIGRATED APPLICATION IN THE CLOUD
* Stage 4: MIGRATING THE EXTERNAL DATABASE APLLICTATIONS

## Stage 1: MIGRATING THE SQL SERVER CLUSTER TO RDS

<image>

WE will have to migrate the database layer of the application to an instance running Windows Server 2016 on AWS

Here are technical steps that can be used to migrate a shared database running on Windows Server 2008 R2 to an AWS cloud database running Windows Server 2016:

* Create an Amazon RDS instance for SQL Server 2016, this will be the target database.

* Create a backup of the source database and store it in an S3 bucket for easy access.

* Create a new Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance running Windows Server 2016, this will be used as a migration host.

* On the migration host, install the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and the AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) connectors.

* Use the SSMS to restore the backup of the source database to the migration host.

* Use the AWS DMS to create a replication task that will migrate the data from the source database to the target RDS instance.

* Configure the replication task to include all necessary data and schema objects, such as tables, views, stored procedures, and indexes.

* Start the replication task, monitor its progress and troubleshoot if necessary.

* Once the migration is complete, run validation tests to ensure that the data in the target RDS instance is accurate and consistent with the source database.

* Update the application configuration to point to the new RDS instance as the new database endpoint.

* Test the application, and ensure that it's working


## STAGE 2: MIGRATING THE APPLICATION LAYER TO AWS CLOUD

WE will have to migrate the application layer of the application to an instance running Windows Server 2016 on AWS

* Set up an AWS Application Discovery Service (ADS) agent on the source Windows Server 2006 machine to inventory the application and dependencies.

* Create IAM user for AWS Replication Agent

* Install the AWS Replication Agents on source servers

* Launch the test instances and migrate the application to the test instances

* Use AMS to migrate the application to the target environment. This step involves creating the target resources, such as the EC2 instances, EBS volumes, and VPC settings, as specified in the migration plan.

* Test the migrated application in the target environment to ensure that it is working as expected.

* Once the migration is done, you can use the Application Discovery Service to validate that all the dependencies are met and that the application is running as expected.




## STAGE 3: INTEGRATING ON-PREMISE SAP ERP TO THE MIGRATED APPLICATION IN THE CLOUD

We will integrate on-premises SAP ERP and SAP PI middleware with the migrated application using Amazon API Gateway

< images> 

* Create a VPC Endpoint or establish a VPN connection between your on-premises data center and AWS VPC to allow your application to securely access the on-premises systems.

* Create a new RESTful API in Amazon API Gateway.

* Create new resources and methods (e.g. GET, POST) for the API.

* Create an integration for each method, which maps to the corresponding on-premises web service.

* Use the Integration Request and Integration Response settings to convert the data format between the on-premises web service and the API Gateway request/response format.

* Deploy the API to a stage, such as prod or test.

* Test the integration by invoking the API methods and checking the results.

* Add necessary security measures such as access control, authentication, and authorization.


* Update the on-premise systems configuration to point to the new API endpoint.



## STAGE 4: MIGRATING THE EXTERNAL DATABASE APLLICTATIONS

The external database applications are integrated with the shared database through complex SQL queries, stored procedures, or jobs, so it may be necessary to also migrate those applications to AWS

* Create a backup of the external databases and store them in an S3 bucket for easy access.

* Create a new Amazon RDS instance or Amazon Aurora cluster running the same version of the database software as the external databases.

* Restore the backups of the external databases to the new RDS instances or Aurora cluster.

* Test the restored databases to ensure that they are working correctly and that all data is present.

* Update the application's connection strings to point to the new RDS instances or Aurora cluster.

* Test the application to ensure that it is able to connect to and query the new RDS instances or Aurora cluster.

* For the integration with the external databases, you can use the Database Migration Service (DMS) that allows you to replicate and migrate data from a source database, like your on-premise SQL Server, to a target database in AWS.

* Once the migration is complete, monitor the performance of the RDS instances or Aurora cluster, and troubleshoot as needed.
